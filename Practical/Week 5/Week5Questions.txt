Q1 - Given an unsorted array of alphabets containing duplicate elements design a algorithm and implement it using  a program to 
find which alphabet has maximum number of occurance and print it

Q2 - You have been given two sorted integers of size m and n design an algorithm to find list of element to find common 
elements to both the lists.

Q3 - Given an unsorted array of integers design a algorithm and implement it using a program to check whether two element exist such 
 *that their sum is equivalent to the given key
