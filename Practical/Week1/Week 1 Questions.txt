Q1. Given an array of non negetive intefers , design a linear algorithm( O(n) time complexity) and implement it using a program to find whether a given key element is present in the array or not.
Also find the total number of comparisions done.



Q2. Given an already sorted array of positive integers , design an algorithm( O(log n) time complexity) and implement it using a program to find whether a given key is present in the array or not.
Also find the total number of comparisions done.(Use binary search).
